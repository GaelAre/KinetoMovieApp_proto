## Overview

### Description
Kineto is an app which allows a user to view a selection of movies currently being shown at theaters close to their location. They will be able to select a specific theater and time slot to buy tickets for. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Showtimes/Theaters
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but could be developed for use on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features as it would likely be the most used format.
- **Story:** Takes the general location of user and allows them to see theater options near them. User then has the ability to purhcase tickets for any chosen theater. 
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, but only those +18 may be able to purchase tickets. 
- **Habit:** This app would be used occasionally, whenever the situation of finding a suitable theater and time for a movie may arise.
- **Scope:** First, the app may be limited to only showing current movies and their times, then perhaps reviews for the movies and sections dedicated to specific genres may be added in the future.
